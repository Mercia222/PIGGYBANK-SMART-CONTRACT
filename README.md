#PIGGYBANK SMART CONTRACT 

The piggybank concept is well-known and has been around for a while now. A piggybank is mostly known as a container (usually in the shape of a pig) that holds coins/money and is especially used by children and young people for saving money. Therefore it is impossible to take back and remove money from it unless you break it. 

When it comes to Solidity, a piggybank smart contract is a self-isolated saving structure that enables a user to save money in a given account. Only the appointed owner by the smart contract can withdraw the money from that particular account. 

Once the money has been withdrawn, the self-destruct is used to destroy the smart contract and remove all the byte code from it.
